"""An interface for publishing rich data to frontends.

There are two components of the display system:

* Display formatters, which take a Python object and compute the
  representation of the object in various formats (text, HTML, SVG, etc.).
* The display publisher that is used to send the representation data to the
  various frontends.

This module defines the logic display publishing. The display publisher uses
the ``display_data`` message type that is defined in the IPython messaging
spec.

    """A traited class that publishes display data to frontends.

    Instances of this class are created by the main IPython object and should
    be accessed there.

        See the ``display_data`` message in the messaging documentation for

        The following MIME types are currently implemented:

        * text/plain
        * text/html
        * text/markdown
        * text/latex
        * application/json
        * application/javascript
        * image/png
        * image/jpeg
        * image/svg+xml

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : dict
            A dictionary having keys that are valid MIME types (like
            'text/plain' or 'image/svg+xml') and values that are the data for
            that MIME type. The data itself must be a JSON'able data
            structure. Minimally all data should have the 'text/plain' data,
            which can be displayed by all frontends. If more than the plain
            text is given, it is up to the frontend to decide which
            representation to use.
        metadata : dict
            A dictionary for metadata related to the data. This can contain
            arbitrary key, value pairs that frontends can use to interpret
            the data.  Metadata specific to each mime-type can be specified
            in the metadata dict with the same mime-type keys as
            the data itself.
        source : str, deprecated
            Unused.
        transient: dict, keyword-only
            A dictionary for transient data.
            Data in this dictionary should not be persisted as part of saving this output.
            Examples include 'display_id'.
        update: bool, keyword-only, default: False
            If True, only update existing outputs with the same display_id,
            rather than creating a new output.
