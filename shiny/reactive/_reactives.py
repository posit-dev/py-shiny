    Mark a function as a reactive calculation.

    A reactive calculation is a function whose return value depends solely on other
    reactive value(s) (i.e., :class:`~shiny.Inputs`, :class:`~shiny.reactive.Value`,
    and other reactive calculations). Whenever a reactive value changes, any reactive
    calculations that depend on it are "invalidated" and automatically re-execute when
    necessary. If a reactive calculation is marked as invalidated, any other reactive
    calculations that recently called it are also marked as invalidated. In this way,
    invalidations ripple through reactive calculations that depend on each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    session

    Reactive calculations should not produce any side effects; to reactively produce

    """
    Mark a function as a reactive side effect.

    A reactive effect is like a reactive calculation (:func:`Calc`) in that it can read
    reactive values and call reactive calculations, and will automatically re-execute
    when those dependencies change. But unlike reactive calculations, it doesn't return
    a result and can't be used as an input to other reactive expressions. Thus,
    observers are only useful for their side effects (for example, performing I/O).

    Another contrast between reactive calculations and effects is their execution
    strategy. Reactive calculations use lazy evaluation; that is, when their
    dependencies change, they don't re-execute right away but rather wait until they are
    called by someone else. Indeed, if they are not called then they will never
    re-execute. In contrast, effects use eager evaluation; as soon as their dependencies
    change, they schedule themselves to re-execute.

    Parameters
    ----------
    suspended
        If ``TRUE``, start the effect in a suspended state (i.e., it will not execute
        until resumed and invalidated).
    priority
        The new priority. A higher value means higher priority: an effect with a higher
        priority value will execute before all effects with lower priority values.
        Positive, negative, and zero values are allowed.
