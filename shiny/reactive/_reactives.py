@add_example()
class Value(Generic[T]):
    """
    Create a reactive value.

    Reactive values are the source of reactivity in Shiny. Changes to reactive values
    invalidate downstream reactive functions (:func:`~shiny.reactive.Calc`,
    :func:`~shiny.reactive.Effect`, and `render` functions decorated with `@output`).
    When these functions are invalidated, they get scheduled to re-execute.

    Shiny input values are read-only reactive values. For example, `input.x` is a
    reactive value object, and to get the current value, you can call `input.x()` or
    `input.x.get()`. When you do that inside of a reactive function, the function takes
    a dependency on the reactive value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value
        An optional initial value.
    read_only
        If ``True``, then the reactive value cannot be `set()`.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        An instance of a reactive value.

    Raises
    ------
    ~shiny.types.SilentException
        If :func:`~Value.get` is called before a value is provided/set.

    Note
    ----
    A reactive value may only be read from within a reactive function (e.g.,
    :func:`~shiny.reactive.Calc`, :func:`~shiny.reactive.Effect`,
    :func:`shiny.render.text`, etc.) and, when doing so, the function takes a reactive
    dependency on the value (i.e., when the value changes, the calling reactive function
    will re-execute).

    Mark a function as a reactive calculation.

    A reactive calculation is a function whose return value depends solely on other
    reactive value(s) (i.e., :class:`~shiny.Inputs`, :class:`~shiny.reactive.Value`,
    and other reactive calculations). Whenever a reactive value changes, any reactive
    calculations that depend on it are "invalidated" and automatically re-execute when
    necessary. If a reactive calculation is marked as invalidated, any other reactive
    calculations that recently called it are also marked as invalidated. In this way,
    invalidations ripple through reactive calculations that depend on each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    session

    Mark a function as a reactive side effect.

    A reactive effect is like a reactive calculation (:func:`~shiny.reactive.Calc`) in
    that it can read reactive values and call reactive calculations, and will
    automatically re-execute when those dependencies change. But unlike reactive
    calculations, it doesn't return a result and can't be used as an input to other
    reactive expressions. Thus, observers are only useful for their side effects (for
    example, performing I/O).

    Another contrast between reactive calculations and effects is their execution
    strategy. Reactive calculations use lazy evaluation; that is, when their
    dependencies change, they don't re-execute right away but rather wait until they are
    called by someone else. Indeed, if they are not called then they will never
    re-execute. In contrast, effects use eager evaluation; as soon as their dependencies
    change, they schedule themselves to re-execute.

    Parameters
    ----------
    suspended
        If ``TRUE``, start the effect in a suspended state (i.e., it will not execute
        until resumed and invalidated).
    priority
        The new priority. A higher value means higher priority: an effect with a higher
        priority value will execute before all effects with lower priority values.
        Positive, negative, and zero values are allowed.
    session
        A :class:`~shiny.Session` instance. If not provided, it is inferred via
        :func:`~shiny.session.get_current_session`.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        A decorator that marks a function as a reactive effect (:class:`Effect_`).

    """
    Mark a function to react only when an "event" occurs.

    Shiny's reactive programming framework is primarily designed for calculated values
    (:func:`~shiny.reactive.Calc`) and side-effect-causing actions
    (:func:`~shiny.reactive.Effect`) that respond to **any** of their inputs changing.
    That's often what is desired in Shiny apps, but not always: sometimes you want to
    wait for a specific action to be taken from the user, like clicking an
    :func:`~shiny.ui.input_action_button`, before calculating or taking an action. A
    reactive value (or function) which triggers other calculation or action in this way
    is called an event.

    These situations demand a more imperative, "event handling" style of programming,
    which ``@reactive.event()`` provides. It does this by using the
    :func:`~shiny.reactive.isolate` primitive under-the-hood to essentially "limit" the
    set of reactive dependencies to those in ``args``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args
        One or more callables that represent the event; most likely this will be a
        reactive input value linked to a :func:`~shiny.ui.input_action_button` or
        similar (e.g., ``input.click``), but it can also be a (reactive or non-reactive)
        function that returns a value.
    ignore_none
        Whether to ignore the event if the value is ``None`` or ``0``.
    ignore_init
        If ``False``, the event trigger on the first run.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        A decorator that marks a function as an event handler.

    Tip
    ----
    This decorator must be applied before the relevant reactivity decorator (i.e.,
    ``@reactive.event`` must be applied before ``@reactive.Effect``, ``@reactive.Calc``,
    ``@render.ui``, etc).
