    """
    Create a non-reactive scope within a reactive scope.

    Ordinarily, the simple act of reading a reactive value causes a relationship to be
    established between the caller and the reactive value, where a change to the
    reactive value will cause the caller to re-execute. (The same applies for the act of
    getting a reactive expression's value.) `with isolate()` lets you read a reactive
    value or expression without establishing this relationship.

    ``with isolate()`` can also be useful for calling reactive expression at the
    console, which can be useful for debugging. To do so, wrap the calls to the reactive
    expression with ``with isolate()``.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        A context manager that executes the given expression in a scope where reactive
        values can be read, but do not cause the reactive scope of the caller to be
        re-evaluated when they change.
