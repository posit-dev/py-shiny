    Insert UI objects

    Parameters
    ----------
    ui
        The UI object you want to insert. This can be anything that you usually put
        inside your apps's ui function. If you're inserting multiple elements in one
        call, make sure to wrap them in either a :func:`~shiny.ui.TagList` or a
        :func:`~shiny.ui.tags.div` (the latter option has the advantage that you can
        give it an id to make it easier to reference or remove it later on). If you want
        to insert raw html, use :func:`~shiny.ui.HTML`.
    selector
        A string that is accepted by jQuery's selector (i.e. the string ``s`` to be
        placed in a ``$(s)`` jQuery call) which determines the element(s) relative to
        which you want to insert your UI object.
    where
        Where your UI object should go relative to the selector:

        - beforeBegin: Before the selector element itself
        - afterBegin: Just inside the selector element, before its first child
        - beforeEnd: Just inside the selector element, after its last child (default)
        - afterEnd: After the selector element itself

        Adapted from
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML.
    multiple
        In case your selector matches more than one element, multiple determines whether
        Shiny should insert the UI object relative to all matched elements or just
        relative to the first matched element (default).
    immediate
        Whether the UI object should be immediately inserted or removed, or whether
        Shiny should wait until all outputs have been updated and all effects have been
        run (default).
    session
        A :class:`~shiny.Session` instance. If not provided, it is inferred via
        :func:`~shiny.session.get_current_session`.

    Note
    ----
    This function allows you to dynamically add arbitrary UI into your app, whenever you
    want, as many times as you want. Unlike :func:`~shiny.render.ui`, the UI generated
    with `insert_ui` is persistent: once it's created, it stays there until removed by
    :func:`remove_ui`. Each new call to `insert_ui` creates more UI objects, in addition
    to the ones already there (all independent from one another). To update a part of
    the UI (ex: an input object), you must use the appropriate render function or a
    customized reactive function.

    Remove UI objects

    Parameters
    ----------
    selector
        A string that is accepted by jQuery's selector (i.e. the string ``x`` to be
        placed in a ``$(x)`` jQuery call) which determines the element(s) to remove. If
        you want to remove a Shiny input or output, note that many of these are wrapped
        in ``<div>``s, so you may need to use a somewhat complex selector â€” see the
        Examples below. (Alternatively, you could also wrap the inputs/outputs that you
        want to be able to remove easily in a ``<div>`` with an id.)
    multiple
        In case your selector matches more than one element, multiple determines whether
        Shiny should insert the UI object relative to all matched elements or just
        relative to the first matched element (default).
    immediate
        Whether the UI object should be immediately inserted or removed, or whether
        Shiny should wait until all outputs have been updated and all effects have been
