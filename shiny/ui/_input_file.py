    Create a file upload control that can be used to upload one or more files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id
        An input id.
    label
        An input label.
    multiple
        Whether the user should be allowed to select and upload multiple files at once.
    accept
        Unique file type specifier(s) which give the browser a hint as to the type of
        file the server expects. Many browsers use this to prevent the user from
        selecting an invalid file. Examples of valid values include a case insensitive
        extension (e.g. ``.csv`` or ``.rds``), a valid MIME type (e.g. ``text/plain`` or
        ``application/pdf``) or one of ``audio/*``, ``video/*``, or ``image/*`` meaning
        any audio, video, or image type, respectively.
    width
        The CSS width, e.g. '400px', or '100%'
    button_label
        The label used on the button.
    placeholder
        The text to show on the input before a file has been uploaded.
    capture
        On mobile devices, this can be used to open the device's camera for input. If
        "environment", it will open the rear-facing camera. If "user", it will open the
        front-facing camera. By default, it will accept either still photos or video. To
        accept only still photos, use ``accept="image/*"``; to accept only video, use
        ``accept="video/*"``.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        A UI element.

    Notes
    -----

    ::: {.callout-note title="Server value"}
    A list of dictionaries (one for each file upload) with the following keys:

    * name: The filename provided by the web browser. This is *not* the path to read
        to get at the actual data that was uploaded (see 'datapath').
    * size: The size of the uploaded data, in bytes.
    * type: The MIME type reported by the browser (for example, 'text/plain'), or
        empty string if the browser didn't know.
    * datapath: The path to a temp file that contains the data that was uploaded.
        This file may be deleted if the user performs another upload operation.
