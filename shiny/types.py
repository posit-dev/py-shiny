    Normally, when an exception occurs inside a reactive context, it's either:

    - Displayed to the user (as a big red error message)
        - This happens when the exception is raised from an output context (e.g., :func:`shiny.render_ui`)
    - Crashes the application
        - This happens when the exception is raised from an :func:`shiny.reactive.Effect`

    This exception is used to silently throw inside a reactive context, meaning that
    execution is paused, and no output is shown to users (or the python console).
