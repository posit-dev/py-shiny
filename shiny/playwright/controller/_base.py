"""Facade classes for working with Shiny inputs/outputs in Playwright"""

# TODO-barret; Possibly move all navset's loc_containers to the parent element (e.g. NavsetCardUnderline should have the container be the containing card.) The `.loc` will then point to the `ul` that has the id
# TODO-barret; This should be the container and the `ul#{id}.navbar-nav` should be the loc
# TODO-barret; Maybe add a `loc_nav_item` that contains `> li.nav-item`?
# TODO-barret; Note: We have access to the panel via `.nav_panel("key")`
# TODO-barret; Maybe add `.loc_sidebar` for the sidebar?

Questions:
* `_DateBase` is signaled as private, but `InputDateRange` will have two fields of `date_start` and `date_end`. Due to how the init selectors are created, they are not `InputDate` instances. Should we make `_DateBase` public?

* While `expect_*_to_have_value()` matches the setup of `expect(x).to_have_value()`, it is a bit verbose. Should we just use `expect_*()` as we only use it in a single context? (Only adding the suffix if other methods like `to_have_html()` or `to_have_text()` would make sense.)
    * Ans: Try things out
    * Ans 3-7-2023: Use small names as there is no need to differentiate using longer names.

* TODO-future; Make sure multiple usage of `timeout` has the proper values. Should followup usages be `0` to force it to be immediate? (Is `0` the right value?)
    * Ans: There was no definition of "now" for a timeout. 0 disables the timeout.
"""

"""
# Class definitions
* Fields
  * Try to mirror playwright as much as possible.
    * Do not use verbose methods as we do not need the long name of
      `expect_label_to_have_text()` as there is not `expect_label_to_have_html()`
      or `expect_label_to_have_attribute()` methods. Just use `expect_label()`
  * There are no properties, only methods; This allows for timeout values to be passed through and for complex methods.
    * Locators will stay as properties
  * Don't sub-class. For now, use `_` separatation and use `loc` or `value` as a prefix
* Approach
  * Use locators / playwright_expect as much as possible
    * It should not be necessary to use `assert` directly.
    * MUST wait for `Locator`s to do their job
  * DO NOT provide `value` methods
  * Add _set_ methods (or set like methods) only if a user would perform them
"""

"""
# Mixins
* Use mixins to add consistent functionality to different classes
* These classes should **never** be instantiated directly
* Use `typing.Protocol` to define the interface of what is required on `self`
* Add methods to the mixin if they are consistently used across multiple classes
  * If a method is only used in one class, it should be defined in that class
  * If a method is used inconsistently, make/use a helper method
