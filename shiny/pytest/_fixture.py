Pytest fixture scopes

Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their scope:

* `function`: the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.
* `class`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.
* `module`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.
* `package`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package.
* `session`: the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session.

**Note:** Pytest only caches one instance of a fixture at a time, which means that when using a parametrized fixture, pytest may invoke a fixture more than once in the given scope.

    """
    Create a fixture for a local Shiny app directory.

    Creates a fixture for a local Shiny app that is not contained within the same
    folder. This fixture is used to start the Shiny app process and return the local URL
    of the app.

    If the app path is located in the same directory as the test file, then
    `create_app_fixture()` can be skipped and `local_app` test fixture can be used
    instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app
        The path (or a list of paths) to the Shiny app file.

        If `app` is a `Path` or `PurePath` instance and `Path(app).is_file()` returns
        `True`, then this value will be used directly. Note, `app`'s file path will be
        checked from where corresponding `pytest` test is collected, not necessarily
        where `create_app_fixture()` is called.

        Otherwise, all `app` paths will be considered to be relative paths from where
        the test function was collected.

        To be sure that your `app` path is always relative, supply a `str` value.

        If `app` is a list of path values, then the fixture will be parametrized and each test
        will be run for each path in the list.
    scope
        The scope of the fixture. The default is `module`, which means that the fixture
        will be created once per module. See [Pytest fixture
        scopes](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/fixtures.html#fixture-scopes)
        for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    fixture_func
        The fixture function.
