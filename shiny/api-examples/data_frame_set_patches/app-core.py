        #### Note:
        The data frame will not be re-rendered as the result of `df()` has not updated.

        Once the `df()` is invalidated, all local edits are forgotten, and the data frame will be re-rendered. However, since the edits were saved to the CSV file, the edits will persist between refreshes (when run locally).
