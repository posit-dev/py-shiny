# Shiny `Chat` examples

This folder contains a collection of examples illustrating `shiny.ui.Chat` usage. Many of them require API keys from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. In those cases, the example should have commentary explaining how to obtain keys as well as how to provide them to the app.

To get started with an app that doesn't require an API key, see the `hello-world` example. This example has both a Shiny Core and Express app to illustrate how it's used in either mode.
