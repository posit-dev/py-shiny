# reactive.lock { #shiny.reactive.lock }

`reactive.lock()`

A lock that should be held whenever manipulating the reactive graph.

For example, [](:func:`~shiny.reactive.lock`) makes it safe to set a [](:class:`~reactive.Value`) and call
[](:func:`~shiny.reactive.flush`) from a different [](:class:`~asyncio.Task`) than the one that
is running the Shiny [](:class:`~shiny.Session`).
