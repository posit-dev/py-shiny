# Evals Directory

This directory contains scripts for evaluating the performance of the Shiny test generator.

- `create_test_metadata.py`: This script generates metadata for the test cases. This metadata is used by the evaluation script to understand the context of each test.

- `evaluation.py`: This script runs the evaluation of the generated tests against the test cases. It uses the metadata generated by `create_test_metadata.py` to perform the evaluation.
