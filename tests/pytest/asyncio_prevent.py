"""This script is NOT designed to be run as part of a pytest suite; it demands a clean
Python process because it needs to be run before the shiny module is loaded.

The purpose of this script is to ensure that no shiny module initialization code uses
the event loop. The running event loop during shiny module startup is different than the
running event loop during the app's operation (I assume uvicorn creates the latter). The
creation of, say, an asyncio.Lock during the course of shiny module startup will result
in race conditions if the lock is used during the app's operation."""
