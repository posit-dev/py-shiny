For each card we want to test
Max Height and Min Height: The tests assert the max-height and min-height CSS properties applied to the card.
Header and Footer: The tests verify the presence and content of the header and footer elements within each card.
Body Element: The tests assert the tag name used for the body element within each card (e.g., <span>, <p>, <h1>, <h3>, <h5>).
Fullscreen Availability and State: The tests check whether the fullscreen feature is available for a particular card and verify its initial state (fullscreen or not). For cards with fullscreen support, the tests open and close the fullscreen mode and assert the expected behavior.
